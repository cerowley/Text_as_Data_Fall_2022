Argued December 1, 2021—Decided June 24, 2022\\nMississippi’s Gestational Age Act provides that “[e]xcept in a medical\\n emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall\\n not intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an\\n unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu-\\n man being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.”\\n Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191. Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health\\n Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the\\n Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s prec-\\n edents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe\\n v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.\\n v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833. The District Court granted summary judg-\\n ment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement\\n of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion\\n violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viabil-\\n ity. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend\\n the Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and\\n that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review.\\nHeld: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey\\n are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the\\n people and their elected representatives. Pp. 8–79.\\n    (a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly un-\\n derstood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Casey’s controlling\\n opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the\\n basis of stare decisis. A proper application of stare decisis, however,\\n requires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n  [2] \"2      DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\\n\\n                                   Syllabus\\n\\n    was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey\\n    plurality did not consider. Pp. 8–32.\\n         (1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court’s cases\\n    have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s refer-\\n    ence to “liberty” protects a particular right. The Constitution makes\\n    no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con-\\n    stitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an im-\\n    plicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\\n    right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\\n    Fourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152–153. The Casey Court\\n    grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an\\n    abortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amend-\\n    ment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can\\n    be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but\\n    that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s precedents, which es-\\n    tablish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi-\\n    cation and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies\\n    to such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496,\\n    n. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273–\\n    274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by\\n    the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.\\n    Pp. 9–11.\\n         (2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abor-\\n    tion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an\\n    essential component of “ordered liberty.” The Court finds that the\\n    right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradi-\\n    tion. The underlying theory on which Casey rested—that the Four-\\n    teenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well\\n    as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial.\\n       The Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro-\\n    tects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by\\n    the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights\\n    deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Consti-\\n    tution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories,\\n    the question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and\\n    tradition” and whether it is essential to this Nation’s “scheme of or-\\n    dered liberty.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation\\n    marks omitted). The term “liberty” alone provides little guidance.\\n    Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to\\n    recognize a new component of the “liberty” interest protected by the\\n    Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the\\n    Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse\\n    what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent\\n    views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason,\\n\"                                               \n  [3] \"                    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022)                        3\\n\\n                                Syllabus\\n\\nthe Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not men-\\ntioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125.\\n   Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo-\\nnents of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the\\nFourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor-\\ntion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in\\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state\\nconstitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years\\nbefore Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor\\nhad any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in\\nevery single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least\\nsome stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could\\nhave very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed\\nthe common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex-\\npanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth\\nAmendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor-\\ntion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until\\nthe day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history,\\nand Casey declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis.\\n   Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the\\nface of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an\\nasserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is never-\\ntheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor Gen-\\neral repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly\\nestablished as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc-\\ntion of a quick fetus,” 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au-\\nthorities—Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone—all wrote that a post-\\nquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities as-\\nserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful” and that,\\nas a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from\\nthe attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an\\nabortion right because of the common law’s failure to criminalize abor-\\ntion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni-\\nversal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83\\nN. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late\\n18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abor-\\ntions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the author-\\nity to do so.\\n   Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right\\nitself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the\\nabortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe\\ntermed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described\\nit as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are\\n“central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered\\n\"                                                                                                                                                          \n  [4] \"4      DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing inter-\\n    ests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the in-\\n    terests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what\\n    they termed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S.,\\n    at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those inter-\\n    ests differently. The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered lib-\\n    erty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from decid-\\n    ing how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11–30.\\n         (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor-\\n    tion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other\\n    precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot\\n    be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abor-\\n    tion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s\\n    “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those\\n    criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights\\n    to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distin-\\n    guishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on\\n    which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions\\n    acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe\\n    termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls\\n    an “unborn human being.” None of the other decisions cited by Roe\\n    and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Ac-\\n    cordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion,\\n    and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such\\n    a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30–32.\\n       (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued ac-\\n    ceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and\\n    protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a\\n    past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled prece-\\n    dents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.”\\n    Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It “contrib-\\n    utes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”\\n    Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris\\n    by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important\\n    questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command,\\n    Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when\\n    [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S.\\n    203, 235. Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions\\n    have overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Educa-\\n    tion, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v.\\n    Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny).\\n       The Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered\\n    in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v. State,\\n    County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors\\n\"\n  [5] \"                   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022)                      5\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\ndiscussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey.\\nPp. 39–66.\\n      (1) The nature of the Court’s error. Like the infamous decision in\\nPlessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision\\ncourse with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey per-\\npetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to\\nresolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a win-\\nning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the\\nState’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their\\nelected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views.\\nThe Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the\\nlarge number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45.\\n      (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the\\nconstitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire\\ncountry a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters\\nmuch like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation.\\nSee 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming\\nconsensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said\\nabout the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying his-\\ntory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-\\nfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did\\nnot explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the mean-\\ning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases,\\nthe Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.”\\nId., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from dis-\\nclosure and the right to make and implement important personal de-\\ncisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429\\nU. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinc-\\ntive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.”\\nWhen the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on\\nthe country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among\\nother things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved”\\nand “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe,\\n410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that\\nlegislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that\\naccommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked\\nlike legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that\\nmight be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring defi-\\nciency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary\\nviability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found\\nmuch support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted\\nto justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n  [6] \"6      DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily de-\\n    pendent on factors—such as medical advances and the availability of\\n    quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics\\n    of a fetus.\\n       When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s\\n    central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its rea-\\n    soning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in-\\n    stead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amend-\\n    ment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion\\n    criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and\\n    substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short,\\n    either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analy-\\n    sis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed\\n    what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority\\n    might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the\\n    abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new\\n    test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-\\n    dent. Pp. 45–56.\\n          (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be over-\\n    ruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that\\n    is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and pre-\\n    dictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test has scored poorly on the\\n    workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the\\n    “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these\\n    rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Ca-\\n    sey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U.

Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible\\nform of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate rela-\\ntionships and made choices that define their views of themselves and\\ntheir places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in\\nthe event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of\\nwomen to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Na-\\ntion has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\\nlives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and\\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the\\nlives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality’s\\nspeculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests\\nof the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the “original\\nconstitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social\\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson\\nv. Skrupa, 372 U.

Nothing in this opinion should be\\nunderstood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\\nPp. 63–66.\\n   (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the\\npublic will perceive a decision overruling a controversial “watershed”\\ndecision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or pub-\\nlic opinion. 505 U. S., at 866–867. But the Court cannot allow its de-\\ncisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this\\nCourt is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which\\nadherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If\\nthe rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be\\nthe law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding\\nprinciples of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66–69.\\n   (d) Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con-\\nstitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a funda-\\nmental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate\\nabortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are chal-\\nlenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social\\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson,\\n372 U.

Some believe fervently\\nthat a human person comes into being at conception and\\nthat abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as\\nstrongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman’s\\nright to control her own body and prevents women from\\nachieving full equality. Still others in a third group think\\nthat abortion should be allowed under some but not all cir-\\ncumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of\\nviews about the particular restrictions that should be im-\\nposed.\\n   For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitu-\\ntion, each State was permitted to address this issue in ac-\\ncordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this\\nCourt decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the\\nConstitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held\\nthat it confers a broad right to obtain one.

Although the Court acknowledged that States had\\na legitimate interest in protecting “potential life,”1 it found\\nthat this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-\\nviability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for\\nthis line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard\\nto defend Roe’s reasoning. One prominent constitutional\\nscholar wrote that he “would vote for a statute very much\\nlike the one the Court end[ed] up drafting” if he were “a\\nlegislator,” but his assessment of Roe was memorable and\\nbrutal: Roe was “not constitutional law” at all and gave “al-\\nmost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”2\\n   At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at\\nall stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third\\nof the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly\\nended that political process. It imposed the same highly\\nrestrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively\\nstruck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As\\n\\n——————\\n  1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.

Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186–189\\n(1824), which offers a “fixed standard” for ascertaining\\nwhat our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commen-\\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States §399, p. 383\\n(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a\\nright to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim\\nthat it protects such a right must show that the right is\\nsomehow implicit in the constitutional text.\\n   Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of\\nthe constitutional text. It held that the abortion right,\\nwhich is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right\\nto privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at\\n152–153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been\\nfound to spring from no fewer than five different constitu-\\ntional provisions—the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\\nFourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152.\\n   The Court’s discussion left open at least three ways in\\nwhich some combination of these provisions could protect\\nthe abortion right. One possibility was that the right was\\n“founded . . . in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of\\nrights to the people.” Id., at 153. Another was that the\\nright was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment,\\nor in some combination of those provisions, and that this\\nright had been “incorporated” into the Due Process Clause\\nof the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of\\nRights provisions had by then been incorporated.

And a third\\npath was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments\\nplayed no role and that the right was simply a component\\nof the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s\\nDue Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed\\nthe “feel[ing]” that the Fourteenth Amendment was the pro-\\nvision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that\\nthe abortion right could be found somewhere in the Consti-\\ntution and that specifying its exact location was not of par-\\namount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this\\nunfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely\\non the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of\\nthe “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due\\nProcess Clause.\\n   We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing\\nso, we briefly address one additional constitutional provi-\\nsion that some of respondents’ amici have now offered as\\nyet another potential home for the abortion right: the Four-\\nteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for\\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United\\nStates); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional\\nLaw Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw\\nfit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our\\nprecedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of\\nabortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not\\nsubject to the “heightened scrutiny” that applies to such\\nclassifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that\\n\\n——————\\n  16 The Court’s words were as follows: “This right of privacy, whether it\\n\\nbe founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty\\nand restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court\\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the peo-\\nple, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to\\nterminate her pregnancy.” 410 U.

Accordingly,\\nlaws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to\\nheightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the\\nsame standard of review as other health and safety\\nmeasures.18\\n  With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey’s bold\\nassertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the “liberty”\\nprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment. 505 U.

That is why the Court has long\\nbeen “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not mentioned\\nin the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.

As the Court cautioned in Glucksberg, “[w]e\\nmust . . . exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked\\nto break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected\\nby the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the\\npolicy preferences of the Members of this Court.” 521 U.

The Court must not fall prey to\\nsuch an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the his-\\ntory and tradition that map the essential components of our\\nNation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the\\nFourteenth Amendment means by the term “liberty.” When\\nwe engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear an-\\nswer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect\\n\\n\\n\\n——————\\n 21 Four Essays on Liberty 121 (1969).\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n [23] \"                      Cite as: 597 U.

At common law, abortion was\\ncriminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was re-\\ngarded as unlawful and could have very serious conse-\\nquences at all stages. American law followed the common\\nlaw until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex-\\npanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the\\nadoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of\\nthe States had made abortion a crime at any stage of preg-\\nnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.\\n  Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey\\ndeclined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis. It is\\ntherefore important to set the record straight.\\n                             2\\n                             a\\n  We begin with the common law, under which abortion\\nwas a crime at least after “quickening”—i.e., the first felt\\nmovement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs\\nbetween the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24\\n\\n——————\\narticulate on paper” the argument that “a woman’s right to choose abor-\\ntion was a fundamental individual freedom protected by the U.

We need not wade into this debate. First, it suffices\\nfor present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the\\n16th or 18th week of pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the\\nrelevant period—i.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Four-\\nteenth Amendment—the quickening distinction was abandoned as\\nStates criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy.

Cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of “com-\\nmon law’s harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance\\nof suicide”). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case men-\\ntioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with\\nno mention of quickening) that he had “never met with a\\ncase so barbarous and unnatural.”28 Similarly, an indict-\\nment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-\\nquickening and post-quickening abortion, described abor-\\ntion as “pernicious” and “against the peace of our Lady the\\nQueen, her crown and dignity.” Keown 7 (discussing R. v.\\nWebb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512\\n(1980)).\\n   That the common law did not condone even pre-\\nquickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a\\nproto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a\\nway in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the\\nlevel of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a\\nwoman “with child” a “potion” to cause an abortion, and the\\nwoman died, it was “murder” because the potion was given\\n“unlawfully to destroy her child within her.” 1 Hale 429–\\n430 (emphasis added).

Mitchell, 10 Md.\\nArchives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the\\n19th century, courts frequently explained that the common\\nlaw made abortion of a quick child a crime.

At that time, there\\nwere no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its\\nearly stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: “[U]ntil\\nthe period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and\\nwhatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon\\nthis period of gestation as the time when the child is en-\\ndowed with life” because “foetal movements are the first\\nclearly marked and well defined evidences of life.” Evans v.\\nPeople, 49 N.

See\\nsupra, at 16–21.\\n   Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see\\nBrief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance\\nof the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the\\nFourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that\\nthey were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to\\nthis account, which is based almost entirely on statements\\nmade by one prominent proponent of the statutes, im-\\nportant motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic im-\\nmigrants were having more babies than Protestants and\\nthat the availability of abortion was leading White\\nProtestant women to “shir[k their] maternal duties.” Brief\\nfor American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae\\n20.\\n   Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any\\nreal historical support for the right that Roe and Casey rec-\\nognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based\\non alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap’s A. M.,\\n529 U.

We have held that the “estab-\\nlished method of substantive-due-process analysis” re-\\nquires that an unenumerated right be “ ‘deeply rooted in\\nthis Nation’s history and tradition’ ” before it can be recog-\\nnized as a component of the “liberty” protected in the Due\\nProcess Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs,\\n586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissent’s\\nprofessed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage\\nwith that important precedent—which it cannot possibly\\nsatisfy.\\n   The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepre-\\nsenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests\\nthat we have focused only on “the legal status of abortion in\\nthe 19th century,” post, at 26, but our review of this Na-\\ntion’s tradition extends well past that period. As explained,\\nfor more than a century after 1868—including “another\\nhalf-century” after women gained the constitutional right\\nto vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19—it was firmly es-\\ntablished that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law\\nat issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regula-\\ntory authority. And today, another half century later, more\\nthan half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and\\nCasey.

First, if the “long\\nsweep of history” imposes any restraint on the recognition\\nof unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since\\nabortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the\\nmother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before\\nthat decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to\\ndefend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the prec-\\nedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were\\ncritically different for a reason that we have explained:\\nNone of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe\\ncalled “potential life.” See supra, at 32.\\n   So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe’s\\nreasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent’s pro-\\nposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact\\nthat a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe\\nand later decisions that accepted Roe’s interpretation. Un-\\nder the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are enti-\\ntled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage\\nin that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time\\nand time again, adherence to precedent is not “ ‘an inexora-\\nble command.’ ” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576\\nU. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past deci-\\nsions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one\\nof them.\\n                              3\\n  The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of\\nany serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States’ inter-\\nest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy\\nthat the dissent draws between the abortion right and the\\nrights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt\\n(same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same\\nsex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).

So if the rights\\nat issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the\\nright recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear:\\nThe Constitution does not permit the States to regard the\\ndestruction of a “potential life” as a matter of any signifi-\\ncance.\\n   That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent\\nhas much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women,\\nthe burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by\\npoor women. These are important concerns. However, the\\ndissent evinces no similar regard for a State’s interest in\\nprotecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the\\n“balance,” post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line\\nstrikes between a woman’s liberty interest and the State’s\\ninterest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later,\\nsee infra, at 50–54, 55–56, and given in the opinion of THE\\nCHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 2–5 (opinion concurring in judg-\\nment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not ade-\\nquately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try\\nto defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a\\npregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the\\ndestruction of a fetus.\\n   Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when\\nprenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after\\nbirth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people\\na particular theory about when the rights of personhood\\nbegin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires\\nthe States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic\\nhuman right—to live—at least until an arbitrary point in a\\npregnancy has passed.

After that point, a State’s\\ninterest in regulating abortion for the sake of a woman’s\\nhealth became compelling, and accordingly, a State could\\n“regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasona-\\nbly related to maternal health.” Ibid. Finally, in “the stage\\nsubsequent to viability,” which in 1973 roughly coincided\\nwith the beginning of the third trimester, the State’s inter-\\nest in “the potentiality of human life” became compelling,\\nand therefore a State could “regulate, and even proscribe,\\nabortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medi-\\ncal judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the\\nmother.” Id., at 164–165.\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n [55] \"                     Cite as: 597 U.

Relying on two\\ndiscredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court er-\\nroneously suggested—contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale,\\nBlackstone, and a wealth of other authority—that the com-\\nmon law had probably never really treated post-quickening\\nabortion as a crime. See id., at 136 (“[I]t now appear[s]\\ndoubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a com-\\nmon-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a\\nquick fetus”). This erroneous understanding appears to\\nhave played an important part in the Court’s thinking be-\\ncause the opinion cited “the lenity of the common law” as\\none of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at\\n165.\\n   After surveying history, the opinion spent many para-\\ngraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be un-\\ndertaken by a legislative committee. This included a\\nlengthy account of the “position of the American Medical\\nAssociation” and “[t]he position of the American Public\\nHealth Association,” as well as the vote by the American\\nBar Association’s House of Delegates in February 1972 on\\nproposed abortion legislation.

The Court did not explain\\nwhy these sources shed light on the meaning of the Consti-\\ntution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything\\nlike the scheme that Roe imposed on the country.\\n   Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent.

But the Court did not explain why mortality rates\\nwere the only factor that a State could legitimately con-\\nsider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid ad-\\nverse health consequences short of death.

Here is the Court’s entire explanation:\\n       “With respect to the State’s important and legitimate\\n     interest in potential life, the ‘compelling’ point is at vi-\\n     ability.

S., at 163.\\nAs Professor Laurence Tribe has written, “[c]learly, this\\nmistakes ‘a definition for a syllogism.’ ” Tribe 4 (quoting Ely\\n924). The definition of a “viable” fetus is one that is capable\\nof surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at\\nwhich the State’s interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe\\nheld, a State’s interest in protecting prenatal life is compel-\\nling “after viability,” 410 U. S., at 163, why isn’t that inter-\\nest “equally compelling before viability”? Webster v. Repro-\\nductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality\\nopinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (White, J.,\\ndissenting)).

Due to\\nthe development of new equipment and improved practices,\\nthe viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th\\ncentury, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or\\n33d week of pregnancy or even later.51 When Roe was de-\\ncided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410\\nU.

The first rule is that “a\\nprovision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place\\na substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an\\nabortion before the fetus attains viability.” 505 U. S., at 878\\n(emphasis added); see also id., at 877. But whether a par-\\nticular obstacle qualifies as “substantial” is often open to\\nreasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, “substan-\\ntial” means “of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or\\nsize.” Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary\\n1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly “substantial,”\\nand trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes,\\nthere is a wide gray area.\\n   This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which\\napplies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further.\\nIt states that measures designed “to ensure that the\\nwoman’s choice is informed” are constitutional so long as\\nthey do not impose “an undue burden on the right.” Casey,\\n505 U.

It includes the\\ntwo already discussed—“undue burden” and “substantial\\nobstacle”—even though they are inconsistent. And it adds\\na third ambiguous term when it refers to “unnecessary\\nhealth regulations.” The term “necessary” has a range of\\nmeanings—from “essential” to merely “useful.” See Black’s\\nLaw Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dic-\\ntionary of the English Language 877 (1971).

In order to determine whether a regula-\\ntion presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs\\nto know which set of women it should have in mind and how\\nmany of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is\\n“substantial.”\\n   Casey provided no clear answer to these questions.

In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded\\nthat those traditional reliance interests were not implicated\\nbecause getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activ-\\nity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually imme-\\ndiate account of any sudden restoration of state authority\\nto ban abortions.” 505 U.

It wrote that “people [had] organized intimate\\nrelationships and made choices that define their views of\\nthemselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the\\navailability of abortion in the event that contraception\\nshould fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate\\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation has\\nbeen facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\\nlives.” Ibid.

That unprece-\\ndented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Con-\\nstitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Con-\\nstitution gives the judiciary “neither Force nor Will.” The\\nFederalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole au-\\nthority is to exercise “judgment”—which is to say, the au-\\nthority to judge what the law means and how it should ap-\\nply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority\\nto decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently ex-\\nempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis princi-\\nples. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual prin-\\nciples of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent\\nis the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule\\nwere otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Loch-\\nner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis op-\\nerates.\\n   The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of\\nthis Court’s influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in end-\\ning division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe\\n“inflamed” a national issue that has remained bitterly divi-\\nsive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opin-\\nion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judi-\\ncial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may\\nhave “halted a political process,” “prolonged divisiveness,”\\nand “deferred stable settlement of the issue”). And for the\\npast 30 years, Casey has done the same.\\n   Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a\\nconstitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this\\ncase, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey\\nand to return the issue of abortion to the people and their\\nelected representatives. This Court’s inability to end de-\\nbate on the issue should not have been surprising. This\\nCourt cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a\\nrancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settle-\\nment and telling the people to move on.

That has not happened, and there is no reason to think\\nthat another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what\\nCasey could not.\\n   The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the\\n“very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey” is an im-\\nportant stare decisis consideration that requires upholding\\nthose precedents. See post, at 55–57. The dissent charac-\\nterizes Casey as a “precedent about precedent” that is per-\\nmanently shielded from further evaluation under tradi-\\ntional stare decisis principles. See post, at 57.

We have also explained why that is so: rights regard-\\ning contraception and same-sex relationships are inher-\\nently different from the right to abortion because the latter\\n(as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey\\ntermed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis de-\\nleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abor-\\ntion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights\\nrecognized in those other cases or by “appeals to a broader\\nright to autonomy.” Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we\\ncould be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these\\ncases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the\\ndissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n [80] \"72   DOBBS v.

If viability was not an essential part of the rule\\nadopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make\\nthat comparison.\\n   The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.

It de-\\nscribed the rule as Roe’s “central holding,” 505 U.

In Casey, the Court held that Pennsylva-\\nnia’s spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitu-\\ntional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to\\nabortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had\\na reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U. S., at 887–\\n898. The same is true of Whole Women’s Health, which held\\nthat certain rules that required physicians performing\\nabortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital\\nwere facially unconstitutional because they placed “a sub-\\nstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previabil-\\nity abortion.” 579 U. S., at 591 (emphasis added).\\n    For all these reasons, stare decisis cannot justify the new\\n“reasonable opportunity” rule propounded by the concur-\\nrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must\\nstand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to\\nshow that this rule represents a correct interpretation of\\nthe Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the\\nright to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is\\n“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ ” and\\n“ ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’ ” Glucksberg,\\n521 U. S., at 720–721. Nor does it propound any other the-\\nory that could show that the Constitution supports its new\\nrule. And if the Constitution protects a woman’s right to\\nobtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that\\nright should end after the point at which all “reasonable”\\nwomen will have decided whether to seek an abortion.\\nWhile the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial min-\\nimalism, “we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision\\nsimply because it is narrow; it must also be right.” Citizens\\nUnited, 558 U. S., at 375 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring).

Some States have\\nset deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter\\nthan Mississippi’s. See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproduc-\\ntive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law\\nwith bans “at cascading intervals of two to three weeks” be-\\nginning at six weeks), reh’g en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550\\n(CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippi’s 15-week rule\\nis constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on\\nthe constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter dead-\\nlines or no deadline at all. The “measured course” charted\\nby the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the\\nCourt answered the question that the concurrence seeks to\\ndefer.\\n   Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule sug-\\ngested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the dif-\\nficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example,\\nif the period required to give women a “reasonable” oppor-\\ntunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concur-\\nrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percent-\\nage of women make that choice, see post, at 1–2, 9–10, we\\nwould have to identify the relevant percentage. It would\\nalso be necessary to explain what the concurrence means\\nwhen it refers to “rare circumstances” that might justify an\\nexception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give\\nwomen a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it\\nwould be necessary to decide whether factors other than\\npromptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether\\nsuch an opportunity was available.\\n   In sum, the concurrence’s quest for a middle way would\\nonly put off the day when we would be forced to confront the\\nquestion we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and\\nCasey would be prolonged.

The Mis-\\nsissippi Legislature’s findings recount the stages of “human\\nprenatal development” and assert the State’s interest in\\n“protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). The legislature\\nalso found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typi-\\ncally use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the\\nlegislature found the use of this procedure “for nonthera-\\npeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dan-\\ngerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the med-\\nical profession.” §2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U.

Respond-\\nents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth\\nAmendment’s guarantee that no State shall “deprive any\\nperson of life, liberty, or property without due process of\\nlaw.” The Court well explains why, under our substantive\\ndue process precedents, the purported right to abortion is\\nnot a form of “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause.\\nSuch a right is neither “deeply rooted in this Nation’s his-\\ntory and tradition” nor “implicit in the concept of ordered\\nliberty.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721\\n(1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he idea that\\nthe Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the\\nDue Process Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical.”\\nJune Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U.

Other sources, by contrast, suggest that “due pro-\\ncess of law” prohibited legislatures “from authorizing the\\ndeprivation of a person’s life, liberty, or property without\\nproviding him the customary procedures to which freemen\\nwere entitled by the old law of England.” United States v.\\nVaello Madero, 596 U.

It does not, as the Court’s substantive due process\\ncases suppose, “forbi[d] the government to infringe certain\\n‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what pro-\\ncess is provided.” Reno v.

In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\\n505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abor-\\ntion guarantee in “the liberty protected by the Fourteenth\\nAmendment,” but, rather than a “right of privacy,” it in-\\nvoked an ethereal “right to define one’s own concept of ex-\\nistence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of\\nhuman life.” Id., at 851. As the Court’s preferred manifes-\\ntation of “liberty” changed, so, too, did the test used to pro-\\ntect it, as Roe’s author lamented. See Casey, 505 U. S., at\\n930 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\\npart) (“[T]he Roe framework is far more administrable, and\\nfar less manipulable, than the ‘undue burden’ standard”).\\n   Now, in this case, the nature of the purported “liberty”\\nsupporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Re-\\nspondents and the United States propose no fewer than\\nthree different interests that supposedly spring from the\\nDue Process Clause. They include “bodily integrity,” “per-\\nsonal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and\\nfaith,” Brief for Respondents 21, and “women’s equal citi-\\nzenship,” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That\\n50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still\\ncannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake\\nproves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a pol-\\nicy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.\\n   Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of\\nconstitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies\\na “fundamental” right for one class of individuals, it invokes\\nthe Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of\\nstatutes that deny the right to others.

And they stress that a signifi-\\ncant percentage of Americans with pro-life views are\\nwomen.\\n   When it comes to abortion, one interest must prevail over\\nthe other at any given point in a pregnancy. Many Ameri-\\ncans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the preg-\\nnant woman. Many other Americans of good faith instead\\nwould prioritize the interests in protecting fetal life—at\\nleast unless, for example, an abortion is necessary to save\\nthe life of the mother. Of course, many Americans are con-\\nflicted or have nuanced views that may vary depending on\\nthe particular time in pregnancy, or the particular circum-\\nstances of a pregnancy.\\n   The issue before this Court, however, is not the policy or\\nmorality of abortion. The issue before this Court is what\\nthe Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution\\ndoes not take sides on the issue of abortion. The text of the\\nConstitution does not refer to or encompass abortion. To be\\nsure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects un-\\nenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation’s\\nhistory and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered\\nliberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in Amer-\\nican history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughly\\nexplains.1\\n   On the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore\\nneither pro-life nor pro-choice.

The\\nnine unelected Members of this Court do not possess the\\nconstitutional authority to override the democratic process\\nand to decree either a pro-life or a pro-choice abortion policy\\nfor all 330 million people in the United States.\\n   Instead of adhering to the Constitution’s neutrality, the\\nCourt in Roe took sides on the issue and unilaterally de-\\ncreed that abortion was legal throughout the United States\\nup to the point of viability (about 24 weeks of pregnancy).\\nThe Court’s decision today properly returns the Court to a\\nposition of neutrality and restores the people’s authority to\\naddress the issue of abortion through the processes of dem-\\nocratic self-government established by the Constitution.\\n   Some amicus briefs argue that the Court today should not\\nonly overrule Roe and return to a position of judicial neu-\\ntrality on abortion, but should go further and hold that the\\nConstitution outlaws abortion throughout the United\\nStates. No Justice of this Court has ever advanced that po-\\nsition. I respect those who advocate for that position, just\\nas I respect those who argue that this Court should hold\\nthat the Constitution legalizes pre-viability abortion\\nthroughout the United States. But both positions are\\nwrong as a constitutional matter, in my view. The Consti-\\ntution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion.\\n   To be clear, then, the Court’s decision today does not out-\\nlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the con-\\ntrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of\\nabortion for the people and their elected representatives in\\nthe democratic process. Through that democratic process,\\nthe people and their representatives may decide to allow or\\nlimit abortion.

In 1992, 19 years after Roe,\\nCasey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The\\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the\\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After\\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24\\nweeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of\\nabortion than Roe had allowed.4\\n  I have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion.

For\\nexample, American businesses and workers relied on Lochner v. New\\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D. C., 261\\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\\nsubstantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379\\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner.\\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.\\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board\\nof Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy. Much of\\nAmerican society was built around the traditional view of marriage that\\nwas upheld in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was re-\\nflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In\\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless over-\\nruled Baker.\\n   4 As the Court today notes, Casey’s approach to stare decisis pointed in\\n\\ntwo directions. Casey reaffirmed Roe’s viability line, but it expressly\\noverruled the Roe trimester framework and also expressly overruled two\\nlandmark post-Roe abortion cases—Akron v. Akron Center for Reproduc-\\ntive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American Col-\\nlege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986). See Casey,\\n505 U. S., at 870, 872−873, 878−879, 882.

In recent years, a sig-\\nnificant number of States have enacted abortion re-\\nstrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot\\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those\\nnumerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and\\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who con-\\ntinue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24\\nweeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not\\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the\\nState’s “important and legitimate interest” in protecting fe-\\ntal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority\\nof the States—26 in all—ask the Court to overrule Roe and\\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.\\n   In short, Casey’s stare decisis analysis rested in part on a\\npredictive judgment about the future development of state\\nlaws and of the people’s views on the abortion issue. But\\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court\\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years con-\\nflicts with Casey’s predictive judgment and therefore under-\\nmines Casey’s precedential force.5\\n   In any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare de-\\ncisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe can-\\nnot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare de-\\ncisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this\\nCourt had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and up-\\nheld the States’ authority to segregate people on the basis\\nof race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in\\n——————\\n  5 To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for over-\\n\\nruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to\\noverrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Court’s traditional\\nstare decisis factors. The only point here is that Casey adopted a special\\nstare decisis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving\\nthe national controversy and ending the national division over abortion.\\nThe continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws\\nand positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey on its\\nown terms.\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n[133] \"10   DOBBS v.

But the parties’\\narguments have raised other related questions, and I ad-\\ndress some of them here.\\n   First is the question of how this decision will affect other\\nprecedents involving issues such as contraception and mar-\\nriage—in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecti-\\ncut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438\\n(1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Oberge-\\nfell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the\\nCourt today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the over-\\nruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast\\ndoubt on those precedents.\\n   Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related le-\\ngal questions raised by today’s decision are not especially\\ndifficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a\\nState bar a resident of that State from traveling to another\\nState to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no\\nbased on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May\\na State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an\\nabortion that occurred before today’s decision takes effect?\\nIn my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process\\nClause or the Ex Post Facto Clause.

That question is directly\\nimplicated here: Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, Miss.\\nCode Ann. §41–41–191 (2018), generally prohibits abortion\\nafter the fifteenth week of pregnancy—several weeks before\\na fetus is regarded as “viable” outside the womb. In urging\\nour review, Mississippi stated that its case was “an ideal\\nvehicle” to “reconsider the bright-line viability rule,” and\\nthat a judgment in its favor would “not require the Court to\\noverturn” Roe v.

Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judi-\\ncial restraint here, where the broader path the Court\\nchooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have\\nnot only previously recognized, but also expressly reaf-\\nfirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court’s\\nopinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues can-\\nnot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and conse-\\nquential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.\\n                                I\\n  Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the\\nonly question we need decide here: whether to retain the\\nrule from Roe and Casey that a woman’s right to terminate\\nher pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is re-\\ngarded as “viable” outside the womb.

No party or ami-\\ncus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule.\\nAnd as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule\\nplayed only a de minimis role in the parties’ briefing and in\\nthe oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17–18, 51 (fleeting\\ndiscussion of the viability rule).\\n   It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey\\nmade a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the\\ntime for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability.\\nThe Court’s jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illus-\\ntration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented\\nnor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe’s defense of the\\nline boiled down to the circular assertion that the State’s\\ninterest is compelling only when an unborn child can live\\noutside the womb, because that is when the unborn child\\ncan live outside the womb. See 410 U. S., at 163–164; see\\nalso J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe\\nv. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roe’s reasoning “mis-\\ntake[s] a definition for a syllogism”).\\n   Twenty years later, the best defense of the viability line\\nthe Casey plurality could conjure up was workability. See\\n505 U. S., at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court)\\n(discussing the difficulties in applying the viability stand-\\nard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content\\nby opining that “it might be said that a woman who fails to\\nact before viability has consented to the State’s intervention\\non behalf of the developing child,” Casey, 505 U. S., at 870,\\nthat mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viabil-\\nity as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent\\nargument could be made with respect to a law banning\\nabortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at\\nwhich nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant,\\nA.

J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nrule—from our jurisprudence.\\n   The majority lists a number of cases that have stressed\\nthe importance of the viability rule to our abortion prece-\\ndents. See ante, at 73–74. I agree that—whether it was\\noriginally holding or dictum—the viability line is clearly\\npart of our “past precedent,” and the Court has applied it as\\nsuch in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is\\nthat Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law:\\none, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a\\npregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the\\nState’s legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside\\nthe womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former.\\nI would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this\\ncase to consider the basic right.\\n   The Court contends that it is impossible to address Roe’s\\nconclusion that the Constitution protects the woman’s right\\nto abortion, without also addressing Roe’s rule that the\\nState’s interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify\\na ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have\\npartially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United\\nStates v. Miller, 471 U. S. 130, 142–144 (1985); Daniels v.\\nWilliams, 474 U. S. 327, 328–331 (1986); Batson v. Ken-\\ntucky, 476 U. S. 79, 90–93 (1986), and certainly have never\\nheld that a distinct holding defining the contours of a con-\\nstitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the\\nright itself.\\n   Overruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this\\ncase in Mississippi’s favor. The law at issue allows abor-\\ntions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate op-\\nportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a\\npregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy is\\nwell into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now in-\\nexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers\\nshe is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum\\n& K.

J., concurring in judgment\\n\\n   The Court says we should consider whether to overrule\\nRoe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced\\nto consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76–\\n77. There would be “turmoil” until we did so, according to\\nthe Court, because of existing state laws with “shorter\\ndeadlines or no deadline at all.” Ante, at 76. But under the\\nnarrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing\\nabortion altogether would still violate binding precedent.\\nAnd to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date\\nearlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that\\ntimeframe would proceed free of the distorting effect that\\nthe viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The\\nsame could be true, for that matter, with respect to legisla-\\ntive consideration in the States. We would then be free to\\nexercise our discretion in deciding whether and when to\\ntake up the issue, from a more informed perspective.\\n                         *      *    *\\n   Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relent-\\nless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot\\nshare. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminat-\\ning a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be\\ntreated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fif-\\nteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once coun-\\nseled that the difficulty of a question “admonishes us to ob-\\nserve the wise limitations on our function and to confine\\nourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposi-\\ntion of the immediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central\\nR. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372–373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for\\nthe Court). I would decide the question we granted review\\nto answer—whether the previously recognized abortion\\nright bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such\\nthat a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is\\nnecessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no,\\nand there is no need to go further to decide this case.\\n   I therefore concur only in the judgment.\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n[148] \"                 Cite as: 597 U.

The government could not\\ncontrol a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It\\ncould not determine what the woman’s future would be. See\\nCasey, 505 U. S., at 853; Gonzales v.

So the Court struck a balance, as it\\noften does when values and goals compete. It held that the\\nState could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long\\nas the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life\\nor health. It held that even before viability, the State could\\nregulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful\\nways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court\\nheld, a State could not impose a “substantial obstacle” on a\\nwoman’s “right to elect the procedure” as she (not the gov-\\nernment) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances\\nand complexities of her own life. Ibid.\\n   Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from\\nthe very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to\\nspeak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term,\\neven at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abor-\\ntion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever\\nrational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And\\nbecause, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life\\nis rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of re-\\nstrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions\\nafter the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority’s rul-\\ning, though, another State’s law could do so after ten weeks,\\nor five or three or one—or, again, from the moment of ferti-\\nlization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipa-\\ntion of today’s ruling. More will follow. Some States have\\nenacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure,\\nincluding taking medication in one’s own home. They have\\npassed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is\\nthe victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman\\nwill have to bear her rapist’s child or a young girl her fa-\\nther’s—no matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too,\\nafter today’s ruling, some States may compel women to\\ncarry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies—for\\nexample, one afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n[150] \"                  Cite as: 597 U.

Ante,\\nat 4 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).\\n   Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result\\nof today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s\\nrights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yes-\\nterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman con-\\nfronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reason-\\nable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a\\nchild, with all the life-transforming consequences that act\\ninvolves. And in thus safeguarding each woman’s reproduc-\\ntive freedom, the Constitution also protected “[t]he ability\\nof women to participate equally in [this Nation’s] economic\\nand social life.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 856. But no longer. As\\nof today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman\\nto give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A\\nState can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is\\na wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare.\\nSome women, especially women of means, will find ways\\naround the State’s assertion of power. Others—those with-\\nout money or childcare or the ability to take time off from\\nwork—will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an un-\\nsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even\\ndie. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child,\\nbut at significant personal or familial cost. At the least,\\nthey will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The\\nConstitution will, today’s majority holds, provide no shield,\\ndespite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.\\n   And no one should be confident that this majority is done\\nwith its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not\\nstand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for\\ndecades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity,\\nfamilial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the\\nright to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the\\nright to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v.\\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v.

The majority (or to be\\nmore accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that noth-\\ning it does “cast[s] doubt on precedents that do not concern\\nabortion.” Ante, at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring)\\n(advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence, and\\nObergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for\\nwhat the majority does today is that the right to elect an\\nabortion is not “deeply rooted in history”: Not until Roe, the\\nmajority argues, did people think abortion fell within the\\nConstitution’s guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 32. The same\\ncould be said, though, of most of the rights the majority\\nclaims it is not tampering with. The majority could write\\njust as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the\\nmid-20th century, “there was no support in American law\\nfor a constitutional right to obtain [contraceptives].” Ante,\\nat 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the major-\\nity does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does,\\nall rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-\\n19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority’s\\nopinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are\\nunder threat. It is one or the other.\\n    One piece of evidence on that score seems especially sa-\\nlient: The majority’s cavalier approach to overturning this\\nCourt’s precedents.

The legal frame-\\nwork Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing in-\\nterests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across\\nthe country. No recent developments, in either law or fact,\\nhave eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in\\nshort, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already\\nfound all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about prec-\\nedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in sup-\\nport of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not\\nwarranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason\\nand one reason only: because the composition of this Court\\nhas changed.

Ibid.; see id., at 852–853. In those\\ncases, the Court had recognized “the right of the individual”\\nto make the vastly consequential “decision whether to bear”\\na child. Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey rea-\\nsoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman\\nconfronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about\\nabortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to\\nchart her life’s course. See id., at 853.\\n   In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took\\nfull account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the\\nimportance of various competing state interests. Some\\nAmericans, the Court stated, “deem [abortion] nothing\\nshort of an act of violence against innocent human life.” 505\\nU. S., at 852. And each State has an interest in “the protec-\\ntion of potential life”—as Roe itself had recognized. 505\\nU. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that in-\\nterest was not conclusive. The State could not “resolve” the\\n“moral and spiritual” questions raised by abortion in “such\\na definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the mat-\\nter.” Id., at 850 (majority opinion). It could not force her to\\nbear the “pain” and “physical constraints” of “carr[ying] a\\nchild to full term” when she would have chosen an early\\nabortion. Id., at 852. But on the other hand, the State had,\\nas Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in dis-\\nallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And\\nit had an ever-present interest in “ensur[ing] that the\\nwoman’s choice is informed” and in presenting the case for\\n“choos[ing] childbirth over abortion.” 505 U.

How is it that\\nour Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment’s lib-\\nerty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not le-\\ngally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for them-\\nselves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that\\nuntil today, that same constitutional clause protected a\\nwoman’s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a\\npregnancy in its earlier stages?\\n   The answer is that this Court has rejected the majority’s\\npinched view of how to read our Constitution. “The Found-\\ners,” we recently wrote, “knew they were writing a docu-\\nment designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances\\nover centuries.” NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513,\\n533–534 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice\\nJohn Marshall, our Constitution is “intended to endure for\\nages to come,” and must adapt itself to a future “seen\\ndimly,” if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415\\n(1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it\\nis. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that\\nthe world changes. So they did not define rights by refer-\\nence to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead,\\nthe Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit fu-\\nture evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the\\ncourse of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers’\\ninvitation. It has kept true to the Framers’ principles by\\napplying them in new ways, responsive to new societal un-\\nderstandings and conditions.\\n   Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in\\nconstruing the majestic but open-ended words of the Four-\\nteenth Amendment—the guarantees of “liberty” and\\n“equality” for all. And nowhere has that approach produced\\nprouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider\\nan example Obergefell used a few years ago.

Obergefell, 576 U.

See ibid. The Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers\\ndid not think it gave black and white people a right to marry\\neach other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice\\ndeemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the\\nCourt in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), read the\\nFourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings’ union. If,\\nObergefell explained, “rights were defined by who exercised\\nthem in the past, then received practices could serve as\\ntheir own continued justification”—even when they conflict\\nwith “liberty” and “equality” as later and more broadly un-\\nderstood. 576 U. S., at 671. The Constitution does not\\nfreeze for all time the original view of what those rights\\nguarantee, or how they apply.\\n  That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes\\npeople to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the\\noriginal applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no\\nothers, or (2) surrender to judges’ “own ardent views,” un-\\ngrounded in law, about the “liberty that Americans should\\nenjoy.” Ante, at 14.

The point of all these examples is that when it\\ncomes to rights, the Court does not act “neutrally” when it\\nleaves everything up to the States.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by ap-\\npropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness. His position\\njust is what it is: A brook-no-compromise refusal to recog-\\nnize a woman’s right to choose, from the first day of a preg-\\nnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be\\nsquared with this Court’s longstanding view that women\\nindeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868)\\nto make the most personal and consequential decisions\\nabout their bodies and their lives.\\n   Consider first, then, the line of this Court’s cases protect-\\ning “bodily integrity.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 849. “No right,”\\nin this Court’s time-honored view, “is held more sacred, or\\nis more carefully guarded,” than “the right of every individ-\\nual to the possession and control of his own person.” Union\\nPacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see\\nCruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269\\n(1990) (Every adult “has a right to determine what shall be\\ndone with his own body”). Or to put it more simply: Every-\\none, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court\\nhas restricted the power of government to interfere with a\\nperson’s medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical\\nprocedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470\\nU. S. 753, 766–767 (1985) (forced surgery); Rochin v. Cali-\\nfornia, 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173–174 (1952) (forced stomach\\npumping); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 229, 236\\n(1990) (forced administration of antipsychotic drugs).\\n   Casey recognized the “doctrinal affinity” between those\\nprecedents and Roe. 505 U. S., at 857. And that doctrinal\\naffinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater\\nincursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a\\npregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experi-\\nences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treat-\\nments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n[169] \"22   DOBBS v.

That women happily\\nundergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord\\ndoes not lessen how far a State impinges on a woman’s body\\nwhen it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for\\nsome women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically\\nnecessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S., at 153. The ma-\\njority does not say—which is itself ominous—whether a\\nState may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion\\nwhen she and her doctor have determined it is a needed\\nmedical treatment.\\n  So too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of deci-\\nsions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of pri-\\nvate choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate\\nrelationships, and procreation. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 851,\\n857; Roe, 410 U. S., at 152–153; see also ante, at 31–32 (list-\\ning the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on).\\nThose cases safeguard particular choices about whom to\\nmarry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live\\nwith; how to raise children—and crucially, whether and\\nwhen to have children. In varied cases, the Court explained\\nthat those choices—“the most intimate and personal” a per-\\nson can make—reflect fundamental aspects of personal\\nidentity; they define the very “attributes of personhood.”\\nCasey, 505 U. S., at 851. And they inevitably shape the na-\\nture and future course of a person’s life (and often the lives\\nof those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices\\nbelong to the individual, and not the government. That is\\nthe essence of what liberty requires.\\n  And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly\\nsaid, even when those living in 1868 would not have recog-\\nnized the claim—because they would not have seen the per-\\nson making it as a full-fledged member of the community.\\nThroughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n[170] \"                  Cite as: 597 U.

But here is the rub.\\nThe law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a\\nwealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recog-\\nnized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and\\nmarriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving\\nto marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right rec-\\nognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter,\\nit did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Okla-\\nhoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.

So if the majority is right in its legal\\nanalysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those mat-\\nters properly belong to the States too—whatever the partic-\\nular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is im-\\npossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle)\\nhow the majority can say that its opinion today does not\\nthreaten—does not even “undermine”—any number of\\nother constitutional rights.

But the majority gives no hint as to why. And the\\nmajority’s (mis)treatment of stare decisis in this case provides little rea-\\nson to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority’s\\nredoing any other decision it considered egregiously wrong.

Be-\\ncause those laws prevented women from charting the\\ncourse of their own lives, the majority says States can do\\nthe same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell\\na pregnant woman—even in the first days of her preg-\\nnancy—that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can\\nonce more impose that command.

Black-\\nstone called it the “established rule to abide by former prec-\\nedents.” 1 Blackstone 69. Stare decisis “promotes the\\nevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of le-\\ngal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. It maintains a\\nstability that allows people to order their lives under the\\nlaw. See H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic\\nProblems in the Making and Application of Law 568–569\\n(1994).\\n   Stare decisis also “contributes to the integrity of our con-\\nstitutional system of government” by ensuring that deci-\\nsions “are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities\\nof individuals.” Vasquez, 474 U. S., at 265. As Hamilton\\nwrote: It “avoid[s] an arbitrary discretion in the courts.”\\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Ham-\\nilton). And as Blackstone said before him: It “keep[s] the\\nscale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with\\nevery new judge’s opinion.” 1 Blackstone 69. The “glory” of\\nour legal system is that it “gives preference to precedent ra-\\nther than . . . jurists.” H. Humble, Departure From Prece-\\ndent, 19 Mich. L. Rev. 608, 614 (1921).

But none does, as further described below and\\nin the Appendix. See infra, at 61–66. In some, the Court\\nonly partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the\\nrest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare\\ndecisis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found,\\nfor example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined\\nor made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change\\nthat had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance be-\\ncause the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The\\nmajority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of\\nchanged law or fact alone, although that is present in most\\nof the cases. See ante, at 69.)

Contrary to the majority’s view, the legal sta-\\ntus of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those\\ndecisions. And the majority’s repeated refrain about\\n“usurp[ing]” state legislatures’ “power to address” a pub-\\nlicly contested question does not help it on the key issue\\nhere. Ante, at 44; see ante, at 1. To repeat: The point of a\\nright is to shield individual actions and decisions “from the\\nvicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond\\nthe reach of majorities and officials and to establish them\\nas legal principles to be applied by the courts.” Barnette,\\n319 U. S., at 638; supra, at 7. However divisive, a right is\\nnot at the people’s mercy.\\n   In any event “[w]hether or not we . . . agree” with a prior\\nprecedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis—\\nand the remaining “principles of stare decisis weigh heavily\\nagainst overruling” Roe and Casey. Dickerson v. United\\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). Casey itself applied those\\nprinciples, in one of this Court’s most important precedents\\nabout precedent. After assessing the traditional stare deci-\\nsis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible—\\nthat stare decisis operates powerfully here. It still does.\\nThe standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly worka-\\nble. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two\\ndecisions. And tens of millions of American women have\\nrelied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under\\ntraditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no spe-\\ncial justification for the harm it causes.\\n   And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that\\npoint. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual\\nchanges that have occurred since Roe and Casey.

It does not. It makes radical change too easy and\\ntoo fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new\\njudges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one\\nand only one reason: because it has always despised them,\\nand now it has the votes to discard them. The majority\\nthereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law.\\n                              A\\n   Contrary to the majority’s view, there is nothing unwork-\\nable about Casey’s “undue burden” standard. Its primary\\nfocus on whether a State has placed a “substantial obstacle”\\non a woman seeking an abortion is “the sort of inquiry fa-\\nmiliar to judges across a variety of contexts.” June Medical\\nServices L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op.,\\nat 6) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). And it has\\ngiven rise to no more conflict in application than many\\nstandards this Court and others unhesitatingly apply every\\nday.\\n   General standards, like the undue burden standard, are\\nubiquitous in the law, and particularly in constitutional ad-\\njudication. When called on to give effect to the Constitu-\\ntion’s broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible\\nstandards that can be applied case-by-case to a myriad of\\nunforeseeable circumstances. See Dickerson, 530 U. S., at\\n441 (“No court laying down a general rule can possibly fore-\\nsee the various circumstances” in which it must apply). So,\\nfor example, the Court asks about undue or substantial bur-\\ndens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce. See,\\ne.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v.\\nBennett, 564 U. S. 721, 748 (2011); Burdick v. Takushi, 504\\nU. S. 428, 433–434 (1992); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397\\nU.

Applying gen-\\neral standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, just\\nwhat it means to do law.\\n   And the undue burden standard has given rise to no un-\\nusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagree-\\nment among judges. Casey knew it would: That much “is to\\nbe expected in the application of any legal standard which\\nmust accommodate life’s complexity.” 505 U. S., at 878\\n(plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be ex-\\npected in the application of any legal standard. But the ma-\\njority vastly overstates the divisions among judges applying\\nthe standard. We count essentially two. THE CHIEF\\nJUSTICE disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical\\nmajority about whether Casey called for weighing the ben-\\nefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens. See 591\\nU.

As\\nfor lower courts, there is now a one-year-old, one-to-one Cir-\\ncuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to\\nstate laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal\\nabnormality. See ante, at 61, and n. 57. That is about it,\\nas far as we can see.11 And that is not much. This Court\\n\\n——————\\n  10 Some lower courts then differed over which opinion in June Medical\\n\\nwas controlling—but that is a dispute not about the undue burden stand-\\nard, but about the “Marks rule,” which tells courts how to determine the\\nprecedential effects of a divided decision.\\n  11 The rest of the majority’s supposed splits are, shall we say, unim-\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n[182] \"                      Cite as: 597 U.

In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught\\nup, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of\\nexisting legal doctrine. See also ante, at 11 (ROBERTS, C. J.,\\nconcurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had\\nworked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was “com-\\nmon knowledge through the length and breadth of the\\nland.” 300 U. S., at 399. The laissez-faire approach had led\\nto “the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insuf-\\nficient to meet the bare cost of living.” Ibid. And since Ad-\\nkins was decided, the law had also changed. In several de-\\ncisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of\\nStates to implement economic policies designed to enhance\\ntheir citizens’ economic well-being. See, e.g., Nebbia v.

It is, of course, true that many Americans, includ-\\ning many women, opposed those decisions when issued and\\ndo so now as well.

Ante, at 65. This\\nis to ignore as judges what we know as men and women.\\nThe interests women have in Roe and Casey are perfectly,\\nviscerally concrete. Countless women will now make differ-\\nent decisions about careers, education, relationships, and\\nwhether to try to become pregnant than they would have\\nwhen Roe served as a backstop. Other women will carry\\npregnancies to term, with all the costs and risk of harm that\\ninvolves, when they would previously have chosen to obtain\\nan abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Casey have\\nbeen critical in giving them control of their bodies and their\\nlives. Closing our eyes to the suffering today’s decision will\\nimpose will not make that suffering disappear. The major-\\nity cannot escape its obligation to “count[ ] the cost[s]” of its\\ndecision by invoking the “conflicting arguments” of “con-\\ntending sides.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 855; ante, at 65.

S.,\\nat 855.\\n   More broadly, the majority’s approach to reliance cannot\\nbe reconciled with our Nation’s understanding of constitu-\\ntional rights. The majority’s insistence on a “concrete,” eco-\\nnomic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a\\nwide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights—\\nsuch as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to\\nmarry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the\\nmajority’s logic, could transfer those choices to the State\\nwithout having to consider a person’s settled understanding\\nthat the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All\\nthose rights, like the right to obtain an abortion, profoundly\\naffect and, indeed, anchor individual lives. To recognize\\nthat people have relied on these rights is not to dabble in\\nabstractions, but to acknowledge some of the most “con-\\ncrete” and familiar aspects of human life and liberty. Ante,\\nat 64.\\n   All those rights, like the one here, also have a societal di-\\nmension, because of the role constitutional liberties play in\\nour structure of government. See, e.g., Dickerson, 530 U. S.,\\nat 443 (recognizing that Miranda “warnings have become\\npart of our national culture” in declining to overrule Mi-\\nranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)). Rescinding an in-\\ndividual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State,\\nan action the Court takes today for the first time in history,\\naffects all who have relied on our constitutional system of\\ngovernment and its structure of individual liberties pro-\\ntected from state oversight. Roe and Casey have of course\\naroused controversy and provoked disagreement.

But that is not what Casey\\ndid. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles\\nof stare decisis—which the majority today ignores—in reaf-\\nfirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circum-\\nstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It consid-\\nered every aspect of how Roe’s framework operated. It\\nadhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the con-\\nclusion that the law required. True enough that Casey took\\nnotice of the “national controversy” about abortion: The\\nCourt knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a\\n“divisive issue.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 867–868; see Roe, 410\\nU. S., at 116. But Casey’s reason for acknowledging public\\nconflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinu-\\nates. Casey addressed the national controversy in order to\\nemphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases,\\nfor the Court to stick to the law. Would that today’s major-\\nity had done likewise.\\n   Consider how the majority itself summarizes this aspect\\nof Casey:\\n    “The American people’s belief in the rule of law would\\n    be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an insti-\\n    tution that decides important cases based on principle,\\n    not ‘social and political pressures.’ There is a special\\n\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n[203] \"56   DOBBS v.
